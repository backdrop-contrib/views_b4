INTRODUCTION
------------

You use the layouts in core Backdrop 1.4+ to build your website.  They are based on Bootstrap 4 and output markup/classes such as "container", "l-thirds", etc...  This module will help you output the same markup/classes as the core layouts, only on collections of content through Views.

Newer browsers (IE 10+) can use CSS3 Flexbox as an alternative layout formatter.
However, different browsers support different syntax when implementing this.
This module provides a UI/point-click solution to provide a good base for supporting all syntaxes for all browsers that can support it.

It is possible that you may need to write custom CSS in your theme to fully realize your vision, this module just helps out.
